# symfony-routing-skeleton
Skeleton App to show how to use Symfony Routing and Blade Template Engine

**Application Scafolding** has been done using `composer create-project symfony/skeleton sandbox`

Note: "sandbox" is the folder name to create the project into. And it could be any other name.

Scafolding the application using this method saves time, and also avoids many of the errors while developing the application.

**Annotation** has been installed using `composer req annotations`

---

**Base Controller** `BaseController` is used as the base / parent for other controllers. And it contains any common code across controllers.

---

**Blade Template Engine Installation** using `composer req eftec/bladeone`
